## Motivation & Context

ImageUpload cmp (using DropableSection, ImageOnUploadPreview & ImagUpload) will provide client an UI of image uploader section of entity item save page. The files pick can be made with both drag&drop and input files element behavior.

## In app use

Currently, ImageUpload renders only once at the entity item save page.
