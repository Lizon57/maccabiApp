# AppData cmp

![AppData example showing both App messages and Scroll to top fixtures](https://i.ibb.co/LhKCH9j/index.png)

## Motivation & Context

AppData cmp will provide client some extra content related to the page / app, using the AppAdditionalContent cmp.

## In app use

Currently, AppData renders once, as it's part of app layout grid. It takes the block end of layout grid (at Hebew, the left side).\
AppData renders 2 fixtures: App messages (such as "edit sucssess") and Scroll to top button.
